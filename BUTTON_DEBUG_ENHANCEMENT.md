# Enhanced Navigation Button Debugging

## Issue Continues
Even after the initial fixes, the "Lanjut" (Next) button still doesn't work when continuing from "Lanjutkan Pengisian".

## Additional Debugging Added

### 1. Comprehensive Validation Debugging
- Added detailed console logging to `validateCurrentStep()` function
- Shows which fields are being checked and why validation fails
- Logs radio button states, field values, and participant validation

### 2. Button Event Listener Debugging
- Added logging to confirm next/previous buttons are found
- Shows how many buttons are detected
- Confirms event listeners are attached properly

### 3. Debug Bypass Feature
- Added **Ctrl+Click** bypass for validation during testing
- Allows skipping validation to test if that's the root cause
- Helpful for troubleshooting

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Click "Lanjutkan Pengisian" on a draft
4. Look for these messages:
   ```
   Initial formStepsNum: [number] Total steps: 5
   Setting up navigation buttons...
   Next buttons found: [number]
   Previous buttons found: [number]
   Form steps found: [number]
   ```

### Step 2: Test Navigation
1. Try clicking the "Lanjut" button normally
2. Check console for validation messages:
   ```
   Next button clicked, current step: [number]
   === Validating current step ===
   [detailed field validation logs]
   === Validation result: ‚úÖ PASSED or ‚ùå FAILED ===
   ```

### Step 3: Use Debug Bypass
1. Hold **Ctrl** and click the "Lanjut" button
2. Should see: `üöÄ DEBUG: Skipping validation (Ctrl+Click detected)`
3. If this works, validation is the issue

## Common Issues to Look For

### 1. Buttons Not Found
```
Next buttons found: 0
Previous buttons found: 0
```
**Solution**: Check if buttons exist in current step

### 2. Validation Failing
```
‚ùå Radio validation failed for: skim
‚ùå Field validation failed for: nama_kegiatan (empty value)
```
**Solution**: Check which fields are required but empty

### 3. Step Element Missing
```
Current step element not found for index: [number]
```
**Solution**: Check if `formStepsNum` is correct

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If No Buttons Found
- Check HTML structure for `.next-btn` class
- Verify buttons exist in all form steps

### If Validation Failing
- Check which required fields are empty
- Consider making some fields optional for drafts
- Pre-populate required fields when loading drafts

### If Ctrl+Click Works
- Focus on fixing validation logic
- May need to adjust required field handling for drafts

## Quick Fixes to Try

1. **Temporarily disable validation**:
   ```javascript
   // Replace validateCurrentStep() with:
   if (true) { // validateCurrentStep()
   ```

2. **Check specific field causing issues**:
   Look for field names in failed validation logs

3. **Verify form structure**:
   Ensure all steps have proper HTML structure
